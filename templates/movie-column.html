                <h3>Farewell My Concubine</h3>
                <p>Duan Xiaolou (Zhang Fengyi) and Cheng Dieyi (Leslie Cheung) are a pair of brothers who grew up together. One plays a male role and the other plays a female role. They have always worked together flawlessly, especially in "Farewell My Concubine". Famous in the capital, the two agreed to co-star in "Farewell My Concubine" for the rest of their lives. However, the two have fundamentally different understandings of the relationship between drama and life. Duan Xiaolou understands that drama is not life, while Cheng Dieyi is indifferent between drama and drama.
                    Duan Xiaolou married the famous prostitute Juxian (Gong Li) when he thought it was time to get married and start a business. Cheng Dieyi believed that Juxian was a shameful third party, making Duan Xiaolou a traitor. The love-hate war born out of "Farewell My Concubine" began to escalate with the changes of the times, and eventually led to tragedy.</p>

                <h3>The Intouchables</h3>
                <p>Because of a skydiving accident, the white rich Philippe (François Cluzet) was paralyzed in bed and wanted to hire a full-time escort. Due to the high salary, there were many applicants, all of whom were eloquent, but they could not move his heart. It wasn't until the appearance of black Driss (Omar Sy) that he made a decision. Driss had just come out of prison and was burdened with family burdens. He just wanted to find a dismissal letter to apply for relief, and he was obviously more interested in the female assistant than this job. But Philip still fell in love with this young man at first sight. So Desis began a one-month trial period. Although the comfortable environment of the mansion made him feel vain, he still faced many challenges: not only did he have to rehabilitate Philip, but he also had to bathe, enema, open letters, wear stockings, etc. At first, the two people's ways of thinking and values were very different, but as their understanding deepened, they became friends...</p>

                <h3>Modern Times </h3>
                <p>In the 1920s, the United States was in a period of economic depression. Unemployment remained high. Workers were squeezed and became a screw in the production of large machines. Charlie (played by Charles Chaplin) is a low-level citizen. He works day and night in a factory with rumbling machines to earn a meager income. Repeated and heavy work made him breathless. He used people's noses as screws to twist them and got them entangled in the belts of the assembly line machine, which made people laugh.
                    Although Charlie is poor, he is very kind. He rescued a homeless girl on the road and lived with her in a shabby but warm home. Every time Charlie, who was penniless, would deliberately commit a crime in order to find food in order to enter prison. The situation improved for a while, and the homeless girl became a popular singing and dancing star. However, the good times were too short-lived.</p>
